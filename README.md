# Customer segmentation using K - Mean Clustering 
### This project demonstrates how to apply K-Means clustering for customer segmentation. The goal is to classify customers into different groups based on their purchasing behaviors and demographics to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and improve customer experiences.
## Dataset
### The dataset used in this project contains various features related to customer behavior, such as:

1. Annual Income: The customer's annual income.
2. Spending Score: A score assigned to each customer based on their purchasing behavior.
3. Other features: Depending on the dataset used, it could also include features like age, gender, and other demographic or purchasing data.

### Example Features:
- `Age`
- `Annual Income (k$)`
- `Spending Score (1-100)`

## Workflow
### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
Load the dataset (e.g., `customers.csv`) into a pandas DataFrame.
Explore the data using basic pandas functions (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`) to understand the structure, missing values, and data types.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
Handle any missing values by filling or removing them.
Normalize or scale numerical features (e.g., `Annual Income and Spending Score`) to ensure the K-Means algorithm works effectively.
### 3. Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters (K)
Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters for the K-Means algorithm.
Visualize the results using a plot of inertia (within-cluster sum of squares) to find the `"elbow"` point.
### 4. K-Means Clustering
Apply the K-Means algorithm to the dataset using the chosen number of clusters (K).
Visualize the clustered data in a 2D or 3D plot to see how the customers are segmented.
### 5. Analysis of the Clusters
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster, such as the average income, spending score, and any other relevant features.
Provide insights into customer behavior based on the clusters.
### 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering using metrics like Silhouette Score to assess how well-separated the clusters are.
### 7. Applications
The insights gained from this clustering model can be used by businesses to target specific customer groups with personalized marketing strategies, improve customer retention, or recommend products.

## Code Snippets
### Import Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
```
### Loading and Exploring Data
```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('customers.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the data
print(data.head())
```

### Data Preprocessing (Scaling Features)
```python
# Extract relevant features for clustering
X = data[['Annual Income (k$)', 'Spending Score (1-100)']]

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```
### Applying K-Means Clustering

```python
# Applying K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
y_kmeans = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Adding the cluster label to the original dataframe
data['Cluster'] = y_kmeans
```

### Visualizing the Clusters
```python
# Visualize the clusters
plt.scatter(X_scaled[:, 0], X_scaled[:, 1], c=y_kmeans, cmap='viridis')

# Plot the cluster centers
centers = kmeans.cluster_centers_
plt.scatter(centers[:, 0], centers[:, 1], c='red', s=200, alpha=0.5)
plt.title('Customer Segments')
plt.xlabel('Annual Income (k$)')
plt.ylabel('Spending Score (1-100)')
plt.show()
```
## Conclusion
 By segmenting customers into distinct clusters using K-Means clustering, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. These insights can be leveraged for targeted marketing, personalized offers, and improving customer retention strategies. The model helps businesses identify groups with similar purchasing patterns, allowing for more effective decision-making.

### This clustering model is a valuable tool for data-driven marketing strategies, helping businesses make informed decisions on product offerings and customer engagement.

## Future Improvements:
###  Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore different values for K and assess the impact of the number of clusters on the model's performance.
### Incorporating More Features: Include additional features, such as customer demographics or purchase history, to refine the segmentation.
### Alternative Clustering Algorithms: Experiment with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering to compare results.
